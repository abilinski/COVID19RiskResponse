# Introduction

During the spring 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, all 50 states recommended or mandated public school closures, impacting at least 124,000 US schools and 55.1 million students [@noauthor_map_2020].  Reopenings have proven challenging, and as of December 9, 2020, only 33\% of K-12 students were offered full-time in-person learning [@noauthor_k-12_nodate].  Where in-person schooling has been offered, a substantial percentage of families have opted out, including more than half in parts of Orange County, Florida and 70% in New York City [@noauthor_more_nodate; @shapiro_when_2020].  Nevertheless, many parents and advocates have objected strongly to school closures [@shapiro_how_2020], and the Biden administration has stated a priority to facilitate safe, in-person school reopening [@noauthor_combating_nodate].

Debates around school reopening have been heated and often invoked seemingly contradictory evidence about safety.  For example, a number of well-studied cases in school settings have found minimal secondary transmission [@macartney_transmission_2020; @fontanet_sars-cov-2_2020; @yung_novel_nodate].  Nevertheless, school clusters have also been documented, particularly in Israel and in parts of the United States [@stein-zamir_large_2020; @noauthor_iowa_nodate; @torres_sars-cov-2_nodate], and some observational studies suggested that school closures may have substantially reduced transmission [@auger_association_2020, @haug_ranking_2020].  Proponents of reopening schools point to evidence that COVID-19 is most often mild in children [@dong_epidemiology_2020], while others have expressed concern about transmission to staff, families and the community.  The discord plays out similarly on a macro scale: a number of Asian and European countries reopened schools with physical distancing when community transmission was low and reported negligible increases in transmission [@noauthor_reopening_2020; @pancevski_is_2020].  Some, including France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, kept schools open during the fall wave and reversed surging transmission by closing other sectors, although additional closures have occurred following the emergence of variant B.1.1.7. [@vogel_as_2020; @staton_european_2021].  Others, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, and South Korea, closed schools to address rising case burdens [@vogel_as_2020].

Nevertheless, there is little debate that the benefits of in-person education are substantial, particularly amidst reports of high levels of remote absenteeism, increased depression, anxiety, and suicidality, and parent concerns around educational quality [@polikoff_surveys_2020; @gaudiano_missing_nodate; @leeb_mental_2020].  Beyond educational and mental health outcomes, opening schools also improve access to social services for children and labor market outcomes for working parents, especially women [@hess_widespread_2020; @baron_suffering_2020; @bueno_bricks_2020; @lempel_costs_2009; @soland_impact_2020].  In order to reopen safely, it is critical to take a comprehensive account of the full array of evidence and identify procedures to minimize risks.  

We simulated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in elementary and high schools, characterizing how school transmission may occur either as isolated or sustained outbreaks.  While several recent papers have discussed the impact of school reopening on community transmission under different mitigation strategies [@cohen_schools_2020; @espana_impacts_2020; @head_effect_2020], our work focused on the risk that transmission will occur on a school campus and spread to household members. We emphasize uncertainty in transmission risk (rather than focusing on the average) as well as the observability of infections to school and public health staff, reconciling apparent contradictions in evidence. We evaluated outcomes under varying combinations of community incidence, in-classroom mitigation efforts, testing practices, and staff vaccination. 

# Methods

## Analytic Overview

We developed an age-specific, agent-based network model of COVID-19 transmission in elementary and high school communities (Figure \ref{fig1}). We incorporated interactions within schools and homes, as well as those between households outside of school.  Because data are inconclusive on transmission among middle school-aged children, we did not model middle schools explicitly; accumulating evidence suggests that they may be more similar to high schoolers than elementary schoolers with respect to susceptibility and infectiousness [@park_early_nodate; @cdc_covid-19_2020]. 

## Strategies

We simulated different combinations of interventions, incorporating strategies that target the three axes of general infection control in schools; COVID-19-specific countermeasures; and scheduling/cohorting with parameters detailed in Table \ref{tab:tbl1}.

\medskip

### General infection control in schools:

1. \textbf{Low uptake:} Schools implemented no or minimal general infection control measures, such as masking and distancing. 
2. \textbf{Medium uptake:} Schools implemented masking and distancing, and adherence was moderate such that the risk transmission given infectious contact was $\frac{2}{3}$ that experienced in a school with low uptake.
3. \textbf{High uptake:} Schools implemented masking and distancing and adherence was high, such that the risk of transmission given infectious contact was $\frac{1}{3}$ that experienced in a school with low uptake.


\medskip

### COVID-19-specific countermeasures:

1. \textbf{Symptom-based self-isolation (“Symptomatic isolation”):} Individuals in the school were screened for symptoms daily, and those who developed clinically-recognizable symptoms did not attend school.
2. \textbf{Diagnostic testing plus classroom notification (“Classroom quarantine”):} Individuals who developed symptoms were isolated and immediately tested. The school received results within a day, and all classroom(s) associated with an individual who tested positive were notified and closed for 10 days, per CDC guidelines (32).
3. \textbf{Teacher vaccination with an infection-blocking vaccine (“Staff vaccination”):}  In addition to classroom quarantine, teacher susceptibility was reduced to 33% of baseline, roughly assuming that 75% of teachers receive an infection-blocking vaccine with 90% effectiveness [@gallup_inc_willingness_2020; @will_school_2020; @polack_safety_2020].
4. \textbf{Weekly asymptomatic screening (“Weekly screening”):} In addition to classroom quarantine, asymptomatic students and/or staff at each school were tested weekly.  We assumed test acceptance was 90%, sensitivity was 90% during the infectious period, and results were available within 24 hours.  Upon receipt of a positive result, infected individuals isolated outside of school for 10 days based on CDC guidelines, and siblings and classroom members of an individual who tests positive were notified and quarantined for 10 days.

\medskip

### Scheduling/Cohorting:

1. \textbf{5-day schedule:} This scenario simulated a traditional 5-day, in-person learning schedule, allowing for classroom contacts, staff-staff interactions (10 per day), and random contacts between school members (20 per day).  Related arts and special education teachers had revolving contact with 5 classrooms per day.
2. \textbf{Cohorting:} This scenario again assumed 5 days of in-person learning for all students, but with restricted out-of-classroom contacts, including separation of classes for lunch and recess. Students and primary teachers continued to have sustained classroom contacts. We assumed a 50% decrease in the number out-of-classroom contacts during the school day and that related arts were taught remotely.
3. \textbf{Half class sizes:} All students attended school five days per week, but in classes of half their typical size. To accommodate this, the number of teachers was doubled. Limited contacts as in (2) were also maintained.
4. \textbf{Hybrid scheduling (A/B):}  Classes were subdivided into 2 cohorts, and students attended school for 2 days per week, either Monday/Tuesday or Thursday/Friday.  Elementary school children in the same household attending the same school were sorted into the same cohort. All staff were physically present each instructional day. In sensitivity analysis, we considered alternative hybrid schedules. Limited contacts as in (2) were also maintained.

## Model Structure

### Elementary schools

We generated a set of synthetic households from US population data [@wheaton_us_2014], including students, staff, and adult household members (Supplement).  We simulated an average-sized elementary school of 638 pupils from 500 households, of which 114 had more than one child in the school.   We set five classes per grade level, an average class size of 21 children, and one teacher.  We also incorporated 30 additional staff, to reflect roles such as administrators, counselors, cafeteria staff, custodians, special education teachers, and teachers of related arts (or ‘specials’, e.g. music and art).  These were assigned either rotating in-classroom roles (n = 15) or out-of-classroom roles (n = 15).

\medskip

### High schools

We simulated an average-sized high school of 1451 students in 1225 households, with 142 households having more than one student in the school [@noauthor_digest_nodate]. Students rotated among 8 class periods per day (23 students and 1 teacher), with the distribution of students to class periods chosen randomly within grade levels but repeated daily for the full simulation. The high school had 45 additional staff with out-of-classroom roles and 15 with in-classroom roles. In both elementary and high schools, teachers were modeled to have additional staff contacts per day (e.g., contacts in break rooms or offices). 

\medskip

### Out-of-school interactions

Reflecting social interactions and out-of-school childcare, our base case assumed that each family interacted with 1 additional family on each day they did not attend school, randomly reassorted each day.  We varied this number in sensitivity analysis from 0 to 9 families per day out of school.  We assume that when families mix, no more than 2 adults attend at a given time, who are randomly selected. 

## Transmission
At each daily time-step, we modeled dyadic interactions between individuals according to household, classroom, school, and childcare relationships, drawing parameter values from the distributions specified in Table \ref{tab:tbl1}.  A SARS-CoV-2-infected individual transmitted to susceptible individuals according to contact type (e.g. home, school), infectiousness and susceptibility (adult vs. child), symptom status, and an individual dispersion factor.

### Secondary attack rate (SAR) 
Secondary attack rates (SARs) for SARS-CoV-2, the probability that a person with SARS-CoV-2 transmitted it to an individual they contacted, vary by contact type: household, classroom, random school, and out-of-school social/childcare contacts.  While there is substantial variation in household attack rates across geographic locations, corresponding to cultural norms and precautions adopted, we assumed a 20% household adult-adult secondary attack rate over the full duration of an infection, translating to approximately 4% per day [@madewell_household_2020; @fung_household_2020].  This assumed minimal in-home quarantine measures but less household mixing than during full shelter-in-place orders. 

For school based transmission, we allowed adult-adult attack rates to reach up to 3% per day for scenarios with low uptake of masks and distancing, a downward adjustment from the household attack rate to account for less close contact in professional settings.  We developed the scale of reductions in transmission from mitigation measures in line with observations from in household settings with high prevention measures [@park_early_nodate; @cheng_contact_2020] and based on effectiveness analyses for measures like masks [@clapp_evaluation_2020; @chu_physical_2020]. 

\medskip

### Relative susceptibility and infectiousness in children
Household contact tracing studies suggest that adults are likely more susceptible to COVID-19 and more apt to transmit it when infected than children, although data, particularly for the latter, are equivocal and limited by availability and timing of testing [@viner_susceptibility_2020].  Several sources indicate that any differences wane by the teenage years, possibly as early as age 10 [@fontanet_sars-cov-2_2020; @stein-zamir_large_2020; @dattner_role_2020; @park_early_nodate; @fontanet_cluster_2020].  We assumed that elementary school children were half as susceptible as adults while high school children were equally susceptible.  Data are similarly limited to inform transmission from children with COVID-19. We further specified that elementary school children are half as infectious as adults and high school students were equally as infectious as adults [@@dattner_role_2020; @park_early_nodate].  We discuss the data underlying these assumptions in the Supplement and varied these assumptions in sensitivity analyses. 

\medskip

### Asymptomatic transmission and overdispersion 
We assumed that individuals with fully asymptomatic disease transmit COVID-19 at half the rate of those with any symptoms [@byambasuren_estimating_2020].  While reported heterogeneity in transmission may be partially driven by differences in contact rates, we sample individual transmissibility according to a lognormal distribution to allow for some variation by individual characteristics (e.g. viral load) in adults [@kerr_covasim_2020; @endo_estimating_2020]. 

## Implementation and clinical outcomes
We first evaluated the downstream impact of a single infectious individual.  We randomly designated one member of the school community as infected, starting on a random day of the week. We assessed the spread of the virus over 30 days, as in most cases either all infections were resolved over that time horizon or the spread was sufficiently large that additional public health measures (e.g. school closures) would likely be adopted.  For each scenario, we ran our model 2000 times and summarized:

1. Mean number of infections generated in the school over 30 days after index case
2. Percentage of scenarios without transmission from the index case
3. Percentage of scenarios with more than 5 in-school transmissions

We also describe the composition of secondary cases (proportion occurring in students, staff, and family members of students or staff).

Second, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 infections among our school population across a typical school quarter, given a constant community incidence. On each day over 8 weeks, every susceptible individual has a probability of becoming spontaneously infected outside of school that is equivalent to an age-adjusted community per capita daily incidence, distinct from their contact-dependent risk within the school network.  When schools are remote, we assumed, similar to the analysis of hybrid schools, that each family interacted with 1 additional family on each day they did not attend school. For each scenario, we summarized:

1. Cumulative incidence overall and by type
2. Incremental incidence compared to remote learning 

\textbf{Transmission control threshold:} We defined a reopening strategy as controlling transmission in a group (students, educators/staff, or families) if it resulted in less than a one point increase in the percentage of the group which became infected, compared to remote learning.  This threshold is consistent with thresholds used by similar papers and with the generally consensus objective of minimizing in-school transmission [@head_effect_2020; @noauthor_schools_nodate].

# Results

## In-school transmission after the introduction of a single infection

### In-school mitigation
In elementary schools with low mitigation and symptomatic isolation under a 5-day schedule, we projected an average of 2 secondary cases over 30 days following infection of a single index case (Figure \ref{fig2}A, left panel). This fell to 1 case with medium mitigation, and further to 0.4 cases with high mitigation.  Under symptomatic isolation, transmission was most reduced by replacing the 5-day schedule with an A/B schedule (to 0.1-0.4 secondary cases depending on uptake of in-school prevention).  With high mitigation, there were on average <0.5 secondary transmissions per case in all scenarios.  

In high schools, we found the potential for larger outbreaks after a single introduction into the school, particularly when uptake of in-school prevention was low (Figure \ref{fig2}B). For example, with low mitigation and classroom quarantine under a 5-day schedule, we projected 22 secondary cases in the school community over a 30-day period (in the absence of additional public health responses like school closure).  High uptake of in-school mitigation reduced this to 1.8 cases. 

## Quarantine, teacher vaccination, and screening
In elementary schools, classroom quarantine had a modest impact on transmission, although its impact was greater if the index case was a teacher (Figure \ref{figs1}).  In high schools, classroom quarantine reduced projected average transmissions by a factor of 0.23 under low mitigation, but had smaller impact with high mitigation.  We found a low impact of teacher vaccination on overall transmission, but substantial impact on transmission to teachers.  Teacher vaccination reduced secondary infections over 30 days to 95% overall and 96% of the average without vaccination, in elementary and high schools respectively. In both settings, it reduced staff secondary incidence to a third of its initial rate, although the reduction was slightly greater if the index case was a teacher.

Weekly screening was projected to reduce secondary cases by a large degree compared to symptomatic isolation, classroom quarantine, or teacher vaccination: to an average of 0.2-0.8 with a 5-day schedule in elementary schools (varying by uptake of in-school prevention) and to 1.0-4.5 in high schools (Figure \ref{fig2}A, right panel). The impact of weekly screening following a single introduced case was greatest for settings with low mitigation: weekly screening reduced average projected secondary cases from 2.0 to 0.8 in elementary schools and from 80 to 4.5 in high schools.

## Detection of school-related transmission
Across all scenarios, for elementary schools, we estimated that 73% of secondary cases would occur in students, 19% in families, and 8% in teachers and staff. For high schools, 77% would occur in students, 19% in families, and 4% in teachers and staff (Figures \ref{figs2} and \ref{figs3}).  As children are less likely than adults to have symptoms, we projected that 14% of all secondary infections in elementary school communities and 15% in high school communities would be clinically symptomatic and therefore detectable without asymptomatic testing (Figure \ref{figs4}).  With a more expansive definition of any symptoms, these percentages increased to 28% and 29% respectively.  

## Stochastic variation in secondary transmission
Re-running the simulation 2000 times with each set of parameters, we observed considerable variability across possible outcomes (Figure \ref{fig3}). In elementary schools with high mitigation and symptomatic isolation under a 5-day schedule, there was a 79% probability of zero secondary cases over a 30-day period  (Figure \ref{fig3}A, left panel). However, there was a 0.3% probability of five or more secondary cases. The chance of >5 secondary cases occurring was higher when mitigation uptake was lower (Figure \ref{fig3}A, left and middle panels), reaching a 50% probability of zero secondary cases, and an 11% probability of five or more under low mitigation. In high schools with symptomatic isolation, the probability of no secondary cases similarly ranged from 19-52%, and the probability of 5 or more ranged from 13-71%, with long tails of outliers.  However, with any interventions, the long tail of large outbreaks was substantially reduced.

## Transmissions over the course of the semester
With any of the modeled scenarios (symptomatic isolation, classroom quarantine, teacher vaccination, and weekly screening), both 5-day and A/B schedules increased transmission compared to remote learning. This increase was greater when community incidence was higher, especially considering infection risk among staff (Figures \ref{fig4}-\ref{fig5}). Assuming that additional measures such as school closure were not taken, Figures \ref{fig4} and \ref{fig5} display the values of community incidence at which our predefined threshold for "controlling transmission" was met. In elementary schools with medium mitigation under a 5-day schedule, all strategies met this threshold among when community incidence fell below 25 cases per 100,000 per day. The control threshold for the full population was exceeded at 50/100,000/day with symptomatic isolation (cumulative incidence 7.8%, increment 1.002%) and at 100/100,000/day with classroom quarantine (total incidence 15%, increment 1.03% for classroom quarantine and 1.7% for symptomatic isolation).  Evaluating the threshold specifically among teachers, the control threshold was never met when community incidence was $\geq$ 25 per 100,000/day, unless teachers were vaccinated (total incidence: 6.2%, increment 1.9% with classroom quarantine).  With both high mitigation and teacher vaccination, strategies met the control threshold among teachers at all rates up to 100 per 100,000 cases/day.

In high schools, stronger mitigation or prevention strategies would be required to meet the control threshold. Under medium mitigation and community incidence of 100 cases per 100,000/day, only weekly screening met this threshold for the full population.  Under high mitigation, all strategies except symptomatic isolation met this threshold. For the teacher control threshold in high schools, high mitigation combined with either weekly screening or teacher vaccination kept the increase in teacher cumulative incidence below the control threshold at 50 cases per 100,000/day.

 
## Sensitivity analyses
If children were as infectious as adults, the average number of secondary cases in elementary schools 30 days was 1.9 times higher compared to the base case; if adolescents were half as susceptible as adults, secondary cases in high schools were reduced by a factor of 0.3 (Figure \ref{figs2}, \ref{figs3}).  When we repeated our analysis of elementary schools assuming equivalent variation in individual infectiousness for children as for adults, we found more instances of no onward transmission and a lower average number of secondary infections over 30 days, but also slightly larger outbreaks when they occurred (Figures \ref{figs2}, \ref{figs3}).  After a single introduction, all types of 2-day schedules (e.g. MW/ThF vs. MT/WTh) led to similar numbers of secondary infections, similar chance of any secondary infection, and similar numbers of secondary infections among teachers/staff (Figures \ref{figs2}, \ref{figs2}).  The benefits of hybrid scheduling generally persisted across increased levels of out-of-school mixing (Figures \ref{figs5}-\ref{figs6}).   In order for student and caregiver secondary infections to be greater with an A/B model than a 5-day model, >9 families needed to interact on each day out of school.

# Discussion
 
While in-person education poses some COVID-19 transmission risk, the results of this simulation model underscore that it is possible to offset this with adequate precautions, particularly in elementary schools and when community transmission is well-controlled. In elementary schools with adherence to masking and distancing, our results demonstrate most cases introduced into a school would lead to little or no onward transmission. Nevertheless, if transmission occurs, it may be difficult to link to the school, and even modeled scenarios that commonly lead to no in-school transmission can occasionally generate larger outbreaks in a school community. The risk of this is substantially higher in high schools compared to elementary schools.

While it is difficult to determine the exact risk of these low-probability but high-consequence events, community transmission determines the number of cases that enter a school community and therefore such rare but consequential outbreaks become increasingly likely when local incidence is high. The guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding K-12 education highlights population-adjusted incidence as a core indicator [@cdc_communities_2020], and our results provide additional evidence supporting use of this metric for school decisions in the absence of in-school screening or surveillance data.  Nevertheless, while schools may decide that in-school transmission risk is too high above certain levels of community incidence, our results do not suggest that K-12 education with mitigation and/or modified schedules, is likely to be a primary driver of sustained community transmission.  In the event that community-level R(t) exceeds 1, it may be possible to lower this through targeted closure of high risk venues, and maintain R(t) below 1 while schools remain open.

Our results are compatible with global observations regarding school outbreaks, in which numerous well-studied index cases have produced no or minimal secondary cases, but larger outbreaks have also been recorded, particularly in secondary schools [@stein-zamir_large_2020; @link-gelles_limited_2020; @ladhani_prospective_nodate].   Teachers and staff tend to be overrepresented in school outbreaks relative to their presence in a school community. At the elementary level,  they often represent a third or more of diagnosed secondary cases [@macartney_transmission_2020; @torres_sars-cov-2_nodate].  As a substantial fraction of staff may be at high risk of complications, it is important that schools undertake precautions specifically to prevent transmission among staff.   Hospitals have similarly found patterns of staff-to-staff transmission and implemented measures such as reducing opportunities for communal food consumption  [@noauthor_bwh_nodate].  

We predict most in-school transmission will occur in the classroom during sustained contact, and interventions that reduce classroom transmission can be highly effective, including distancing, masking, or reducing class sizes. Reduced density may be achieved through the addition of more staff and moving into previously unused spaces, allowing families to opt out of in-person learning, prioritizing a subset of vulnerable students for limited in-person slots, or implementation of hybrid scheduling. Some have raised concerns that a hybrid model could paradoxically increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools by leading to greater out-of-cohort mixing on days when children are not physically in school. However, we find that the A/B schedule leads to far fewer infections in the school community than a 5-day schedule, a result that persists even with an assumption of substantial out-of-school mixing between families. 

Weekly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 screening is particularly valuable for facilitating 5-day schedules in light of uncertainty in model parameters and outcomes.  There is still debate surrounding relative susceptibility and transmissibility of children compared to adults and overdispersion of infectiousness.  It may also be difficult to ascertain local behavioral parameters such as adherence to masking, distancing, and quarantine protocols, which can vary across settings and over time.  Coupled with stochastic uncertainty in outbreak size and a high proportion of subclinical illnesses in school populations, it may be difficult to detect transmission when it occurs.  The low probability of clinical disease for infected children means that transmission chains in schools are likely to be only partially observed, and linked cases may be mistakenly classified as isolated introductions.  While regular screening can both improve these data and prevent transmission through early detection, at a minimum, schools should be on alert for signs that an outbreak is brewing, and consider screening in response to the detection of any case without a clearly identified source.  Other factors not considered in this work that may affect transmission include changes in parent behavior when children return to school and staff social interactions outside of school.

In addition, a new variant of COVID-19 (B.1.1.7) has recently been identified that is approximately 50% more transmissible than the strains that have previously dominated, with possibly larger increases in transmissibility among children than among adults compared to the previous strain [@volz_transmission_2021].  This variant has been linked to a large outbreak in a primary school in the Netherlands and triggered a new wave of school closures in Europe [@vogeljan_15_school_2021; @staton_european_2021].  If it spreads throughout the United States, classroom-based efforts at infection prevention such as masking and distancing may be less effective at suppressing attack rates. For instance, schools which have achieved attack rates commensurate with "medium uptake of mitigation" may find that the same measures will result in attack rates reflecting "low uptake." This shift highlights the urgent need for data and underscores the added value of routine asymptomatic screening.  

There are inevitable trade-offs between school disruption, risk of in-school transmission, and resources required to implement reopening strategies. We offer a quantitative perspective on the way that in-school transmissions are likely to occur, as well as the impact that proposed protocols could have on that transmission risk. We emphasize that particularly among young children, schools appear to be ‘mirrors’ of community transmission, rather than ‘amplifiers’ or ‘brakes.’  Thus, a reliable way to ensure a low infection risk in school is to reduce infectious introductions, by keeping community incidence low.  However, even when introductions occur, high adherence to in-school prevention measures, complemented by regular asymptomatic testing and teacher vaccination, can also permit return to in-person education with controlled risk of in-school COVID-19 transmission. Local, state, and federal agencies should prioritize these effective interventions that permit the benefits of in-person education while protecting the safety of both students and educators.
