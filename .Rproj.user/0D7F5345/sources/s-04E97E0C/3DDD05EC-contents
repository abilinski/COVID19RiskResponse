# Model

We created an agent-based stochastic SEIR model of COVID-19 transmission, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig_diagram}, including susceptible ($S$), exposed ($E$), infectious (with clinical symptoms ($I_S$), subclinical symptoms ($I_S$), or asymptomatic disease ($I_A$), and recovered individuals ($R$).  Only individuals in the susceptible compartment could contract a new infection, and only those in an infectious compartment could transmit disease.  Individuals with clinical symptoms ($I_S$) were assumed to self-isolate after the appearance of symptoms, an average of 2 days after the onset of infectiousness.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{diagram.png}
\caption{\label{fig_diagram}Model compartments.}
\end{figure}

At each daily time-step, we modeled dyadic interactions between individuals according to household, classroom, school, and childcare relationships, drawing parameter values from the distributions specified in Table 1 in the main text.  A SARS-CoV-2-infected individual $i$ transmitted to susceptible individual $j$ at time-step $t$ with Bernoulli probability equal to:
\begin{align*}
p_{ijt}= c_{ijkt} q_k s_j r_i a_i d_i 
\end{align*}
where $c_{ijk}$ was an indicator variable equal to 1 if individuals $i$ and $j$ had contact type $k$ at time $t$, $q_k$ was the probability of transmission given one day of contact type $k$, $r_i$ was the relative infectiousness of individual $i$ (compared to full adult infectiousness), $s_j$ was the relative susceptibility of individual $j$ (compared to full adult infectiousness), and $a_i$ indicated whether individual $i$ had asymptomatic disease and $d_i$ was a dispersion factor representing individual-level heterogeneity in transmissibility.  Considerations for these parameters are discussed further in the text.

# Household structure

We use a Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics (FRED) to generate household structures [@wheaton_us_2014].  For elementary schools, we sampled from households containing at least one child aged 5 to 10 to identify siblings attending the same school.  For high schools, we sampled from households with students aged 14 to 17.  For each student, we included two adults in the household, based on the average number of household members over 25. For each staff member, we also included a household adult contact, representing a partner or roommate with whom they had close contact.  For computational simplicity, we used Maryland as a representative state, as sibling structure (the main parameter of interest) did not appear sensitive to location.

# Comparison to observed outbreaks

A number of factors make formal calibration challenging for this paper.  First, most data collection has been ad hoc, with some sources biased toward reporting large outbreaks and others toward high-mitigation schools who voluntarily collect and report data.  Without comprehensive data on school mitigation efforts, interpretation can be challenging, as our results emphasize that a large range of outcomes is possible due to both variation in parameters and stochastic uncertainty.  Testing practices vary across schools, affecting reporting procedures, and the definition of "contact" also varies, with some sources including even brief contacts while others require more sustained interaction (e.g. >15 minutes without a mask).  Overall, this section describes available data sources in comparison to our results.  We emphasize that substantial uncertainty persists, and that weekly screening or other surveillance is one of the best tools available for understanding a specific context as well as early detection of outbreaks.

## Differences in infectiousness and susceptibility by age

In our model, we assumed that young children (10 and under) were both less susceptible and less infectious than adults.  To inform these assumptions, we used a meta-analysis on child susceptibility on those under 18-20 [@viner_susceptibility_2020], which was consistent with best-fit model estimates [@davies_age-dependent_2020] and another on child infectiousness [@zhu_meta-analysis_2020].  We also used a number of contact tracing studies suggesting not just a difference between children and adults but also an age gradient in susceptibility and infectiousness.  These included a study from B'nei Brak, Israel on household infections (Figure 4) [@dattner_role_2020] and two studies from France contrasting minimal elementary school outbreaks (despite introductions) with a larger high school cluster in an area with early COVID-19 exposure [@fontanet_cluster_2020; @fontanet_sars-cov-2_2020].  Limited data from Iceland, with comprehensive contact tracing and sequencing, suggested a similar difference between young children and adolescents in infectiousness [@noauthor_exclusive_2020].  Contact tracing data from South Korea on infectiousness, while more difficult to interpret due to concurrent exposures among household members and high PPE usage of guardians of infected children [@kim_role_2020; @lee_absence_nodate], was not inconsistent with this finding [@park_early_nodate].

We focused on data from contact tracing studies that used comprehensive testing of contacts because these were less likely to be biased.  In particular, we did not want to interpret evidence that children were rarely identified as index cases [@zhu_meta-analysis_2020] or had lower seroprevalence in some contexts as evidence that they were less susceptible or infectious [@goldstein_effect_2020].  These differences could have been driven by the fact that children are less likely to have symptoms and be tested and/or that their contacts were markedly reduced by school closures early in the pandemic.  While household contact tracing studies with comprehensive testing avoided this issue, they could have had other biases.  For example, children were unlikely to be caretakers of sick individuals commpared to adults in the household, and may have been shielded in houses with known cases, particularly in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic.  Nevertheless, in general, higher household attack rates in children have been observed for seasonal influenza and H1N1, making lower estimates for COVID-19 particularly notable [@carcione_secondary_2011; @odaira_assessment_2009; @sikora_transmission_2010; @sugimoto_effect_2011; @klick_transmissibility_2011; @wu_infection_2010].  

These findings nevertheless cannot differentiate between biological explanations for lower susceptibility in younger children (e.g., lower density of ACE2 receptor) and behavioral ones (e.g., easier to restrict socialization).  In addition, some studies suggest higher susceptibility and/or infectiousness of young children than we include in our base case [@bi_epidemiology_2020; @fateh-moghadam_contact_2020; @li_household_2021; @grijalva_transmission_2020; @lopez_bernal_transmission_2020].  While we model these possibilities in sensitivity analyses, the bulk of evidence on well-studied school outbreaks has pointed to important distinctions between elementary and high school-aged children.  For example, when Israel experienced significant outbreaks upon return to school in the early summer, there was a significant outbreak of 178 cases in a middle/high school (concentrated in grades 7-9), but elementary school outbreaks were generally reported as smaller (e.g. 33 cases) [@stein-zamir_large_2020; @vogel_as_2020].  This difference was also apparent in informal databases, with high schools largely responsible for outbreaks of more than 50 people (e.g. in New Zealand and the US prior to social distancing and Australia, where a school outbreak was reported to be driven by high schoolers) [@leclerc_what_2020; @jones_covid-19_2020; @noauthor_national_nodate].  In the Netherlands, a health official was quoted saying that significant outbreaks occurred mainly in high schools and universities prior to an elementary school outbreak with B.1.1.7 [@vogeljan_15_school_2021].  Exceptions often included significant outbreaks among teachers (e.g., in Chile [@torres_sars-cov-2_nodate] and Singapore [@noauthor_covid-19_nodate-1]).  

\medskip

## Secondary cases

Our results are broadly consistent a few key features of observed data.  First, well-studied cases have led to no or minimal outbreaks in a number of settings.  In passive surveillance from the United Kindom during the summer, in-school transmission was identified from 39% of index cases in secondary schools and 26% of cases in primary schools "in the context of small class or bubble sizes, half empty schools, and extensive hygiene measures."  This is similar to what we predicted with an A/B model in secondary schools with medium mitigation (36%) and a low mitigation scenario in elementary schools (23%).  No onward transmission was found in Singapore or Ireland, each with 3 seed cases [@yung_novel_nodate; @heavey_no_2020]. In Rhode Island childcare settings, which had small class sizes, onward transmission was documented in 4/29 index cases (14%), consistent with 1/2 class size scenario and high mitigation (12%) [@link-gelles_limited_2020].  However limited testing in some of these studies may have missed subclinical cases.  A recent paper estimated the number of direct secondary infections to students and staff from each introduced case in the context of weekly or biweekly testing in high-mitigation K-12 independent schools to be about 0.2 to 0.5, similar to our estimates of 0.23 to 0.4 with weekly testing and high mitigation [@gillespie_experience_2021].  (Testing did not include families and so they are not included in those model estimates.)

Second, several data sources showed signs of overdispersion with the possibility of large outbreaks alongside cases without apparent transmission.  In the Rhode Island example, one outbreak involved 10 cases among contacts (10 children, four staff members, and one parent); in another study from Australia, 9 cases in early childhood education centers led to no onward transmission while one led to 13 infections [@macartney_transmission_2020].  If these were indeed caused by a single index case, the level of overdispersion in our model may not capture such extreme outcomes.

Last, teachers were often overrepresented in outbreaks even in well-studied outbreaks, with 16% of staff and 10% of students having antibodies in a Chilean outbreak across multiple school levels [@torres_sars-cov-2_nodate].  In the Australian study, adults comprised 8/18 of secondary cases identified [@macartney_transmission_2020].  

\medskip

## Frequency of infections and subclinical infections in children compared to adults
Our model predicted both lower incidence of infections in children and a higher rate of underdiagnosis.  With these combined, we would expect to see fewer cases in children, but a smaller relative difference when comprehensive surveillance and/or random testing is conducted, which is consistent with observed data.  For example, in passive surveillance from the United Kingdom, staff had more than 4 times the COVID incidence of students per 100,000 across all age groups; however in random testing, observed prevalence was roughly equal among students and staff [@ismail_sars-cov-2_2020; @noauthor_covid-19_nodate-2].  In elementary schools in New York in fall 2020, schools reported substantially fewer cases in elementary school students than in staff per population, but in random surveillance testing from the same period in New York City (manually extracted and analyzed by others), prevalence was roughly equal in students and staff [@oster_opinion_2020; @noauthor_covid_nodate].  While these are difficult to compare directly as people who self-isolate for symptoms are not present for random testing, the contrast remains striking.  Less systematically, a major outbreak in an Israeli high school was detected from wide-scale testing after observing 2 unlinked community cases [@stein-zamir_large_2020], and the first Ontario school to participate in voluntary mass asymptomatic screening closed after uncovering a substantial number of previously undetected cases [@noauthor_second_2020].  In an analysis of two schools with biweekly or weekly testing, 3% of cases in elementary school-aged children, 25% in middle school-aged children, and 9% in high school-aged children were symptomatic at the time of testing, compared to 48% in adults [@gillespie_experience_2021].

\medskip

## Effective reproduction number

In Figure \ref{figr}, we display the effective reproduction number associated with different scenarios.  One modeling study estimated that from August through October 2020, there was an average effective reproduction number of 0.54 [0.44-0.62] for children 0-9 and 0.75 [0.59-0.89] for children 10-19 [@monod_age_2020].  As noted in the introduction of this article, school openings varied considerably across the country, but both of these fall within our range of estimates.  For elementary schools, it is consistent with full opening and high mitigation, hybrid opening or limited attendance and medium mitigation, or some combination of these with remote school.  For high schools, it is most consistent with high mitigation limited attendance or a hybrid model or some combination of these with remote school.

```{r figr, fig = T, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6.5, fig.cap = "\\label{figr} Effective reproduction number, defined as average secondary transmissions following a single introduction into the school community.  The top panel shows elementary schools, where children are assumed to be less susceptible and less infectious, while the bottom panel shows high schools.  Note that axes differ across rows.  The x-axes vary the level of prevention measure uptake, with low uptake assuming minimal interventions and high uptake assuming intensive interventions.  Line colors correspond to scheduling strategies."}

## Population-level studies

While we do not directly model full community incidence, two recent studies using quasi-experimental data to study the impact of school reopening on transmission were consistent with our observation that there is a higher risk of increased community transmission following school reopenings when initial transmission was high, contrasted to tight null effects when initial transmission was lower [@harris_effects_nodate; @goldhaber_what_2020].
